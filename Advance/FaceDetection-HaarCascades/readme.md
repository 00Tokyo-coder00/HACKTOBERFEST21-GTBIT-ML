# Face Detection Using Open-CV: 
This project takes a gentle look on the Viola-Jones Face Detection Technique, popularly known as Haar Cascades, and exploring some of the interesting concepts proposed by them. 
 It is an Object Detection Algorithm used to identify faces in an image or a real time video.
